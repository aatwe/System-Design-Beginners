Whatuse cases for end user		//Can have many use cases

	3 people we have

a)	Customer: who Consumes the video		//priority1
		What can customer do?
		a.1)	Play a video from timestamp	
				
			a.1.1)	API	//play(user,video,ts)
				//What it does? sends back time stamp
				
				//One more actor 	Video Consuming Service 	//decidsehow much video to send
				//who handles this? network protocol  // adaptive bitrate protocol // http dash
				//hwo bandwidth decided? device + network requirements

				//How HTTP Dash works?

 
		a.2) 	go to a  priviosuly visited video and playfrom same timestamp
			//API seek(user,video)
			//What it does? sends back time stamp
			
			a.2.1) 		Video Consuming Service
		
 		a.3)	view max quality allowed

			//API : HTTP Dash		
				//Linked with HTTP Dash
				//One more actor 	Video Consuming Service	//decidsehow much video to send
				//who handles this? network protocol  // adaptive bitrate protocol // http dash
				//hwo bandwidth decided? device + network requirements

				//How HTTP Dash works?
			a.3.1) Video Consuming Service

		a.4)	non stop playing when watching (Given bandwidth isok)
			API: ///getVideoFrame(user,video, ts)
			//What it does? sends back VIdeo frame

			a.4.1) Video Consuming service

b)	Admin : adds videos to DB

c)	Videographer: can upload videos



When designing api: think who is using it, what is it used for

//play(user,video,ts)  and getVideoFrame(user,video, ts) are very similar

Solution: Cut down 1 and replace

Notice: engineering side similar, but business/analytics side very different use cases
