Objective: 

Learn
a) What Engineering Design patterns and Principles are used to design large scale Distributed systems

	What are large scale distributed systems:
		what is large scale product? High usage/ Compute intensive data  : ex GMaps,lots of data, lots of use, lots of updates, lots of expectations
		What is distributed systems? Server/ Code is distributed all around the world
				Server1: India, Server2:USA etc
				if 1 server crashes, other server can take load + Quick results

b) Use the principles to code live streaming video app




What companies with these solutions expect?
	System Design: Large scale distributed systems
	
	What engineering teams work on? Design patterns
	Ex Celecrity posting something on social media

	Ex bradd pitt posting on Linkedin
		Bradd pitt posting on Youtube

	Objective: Notify followers quickly,+ put less load ons service 
	How to solve? using Design pattern
