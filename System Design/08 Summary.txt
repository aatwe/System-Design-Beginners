In startups we might not have product requirement document

Have to just talk to customers



1) Define requirements as abstract data objects

2) Manipulate and query these objects using apis on server

3) Store data representations on Db

4) What we need to make system possible? 
	Protocols,
	DB Solutions	
	Intermediate Design pattern solutions (Load balancers/ Message Queues)
		//design patterns are converted into tools by companies
		Ex Redis: Caches, Load balancers, 
		    AWS


	//We will use these well built well tested solutions
		

5) Think interaction of tools and services to meet requirements
		How to show video to users? Transform,convert,

		How to stream video to server/ or use CDN solution?	//even if server is close, dont want server to handle all load to static content
										//Give load to other CDNs (ISP Tied : check how netflix uses CDNs)

		How to stream video to client?
