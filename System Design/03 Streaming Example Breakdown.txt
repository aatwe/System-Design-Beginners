What is product requirement?

a) Streaming video (Primary)



Obejctive: Stream video

How to stream video?

a) Capture video from source (8K)
b) Store video in server database
c) Query video later (milliseconds after) Distribute to users


//Important to keep it a black box
//Users just have to hit API
//Give users Clients  //Downloadable clients on Appstore  //Clients take care of API 
//APIs have well defined signatures	
						//What API?getVideo()			// gives object of type frames
						//API signatures are similar to method signatures
							//Difference: API: Queries through a network protocol (Not programming language)
								//What type of network protocol? GRPC, http, FtTP
								//What protocol does? defines how object of type frame will be sent from x to y
											   defines how response will come back
						//What is API Signature? unique signature generated for each API request
						How generated?
							//Create String-to-sign
							//Hash with Private-API-Key	(HMAC-SHA256 OR HMAC-SHA1 Hashing Algorithm //Base64)

//What our system does till now?
	Storing data	
	Query data using APIs
	Test the APIs: think failiure scenarios: --> what if database crashes, What if firewall on internet starts blocking API requests
							What if one service / program we have written misbehaves (Bug, someone entered system and changed code)	
			 think feature requests:  -->  musician playing in event should be able to talk to some audience(Display it to musician live --> broadcast 2 parties to millions of users )

Objective: Design Live Streaming application
