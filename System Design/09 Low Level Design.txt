What High level design discussed: How different components of entire system interact using network calls and APIs
	What systems own? business data related to service


We lose view of:
How User interacts with gateways : 

How gateways sending requests to returns services	

How return services interact with Db


//We will work on chunks and code it down


Objective: Figure out:
	a) How user fetches video
	b) How user views video
	c) How user can fetch more of video until video ends



What developer has to think? Actions


a) What actions user needs to perform
a.1) Play video from timestamp x
a.2) pause video
a.3) If you close and again login -> resume at same place, how? cache video somewhere
	//dont have to buffer everything meanwhile
	//dont have to cache all videos, cache only some videos

a.4) Tackle concurrency, latency, throughput issues
	throughput max : dont want how quickly, but continous function of pipeline

	//Context switch : if video comes --> consider important
