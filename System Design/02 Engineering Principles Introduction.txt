Scenario: You join Hotstar, Youtube , Zoom

How broadcasting of videos to millions of people? Event X



1) Define requirement from User's perspective
	Company --> Product management document (Take User feedback + data)


2) Pick most important features + reduce them to data definitions
	Ex in live streaming systems:
		//Most important features

		2.1) Watch stream live (HD or not secondary)
			Make sure server doesnt go down, bandwidth is sufficient
			

		2.2) Should be able to like
	
		//Data definitons of features
		2.1) How to make sure server doesnt go down


		2.2) How to like?
			get like iD
			get user id
			store timestamp


		2.3) How to comment?
			map to object
			give commend an id
		 	get who typed comment
			when comment was created
			thread in which posted


3) Map Definitions --> map to objects  --> map to Database 

//now we have defined what data we need to store
/What endpoints needed?
	Why endpoint needed? To manipulate / query data 


Ex Read comments
HTTP/FTP/etc API or Endpoints (Method)

Why need API?
Send signal to our server --> server responds with data needed

What server does:
	encapsulates data
	defines endpoints / apis : for external users to query/manipulate data
	
	//Set this up for every feature

We as engineer need to know the most important features

Engineering requirements:
	a) none Services should fail
		how? multiple spread out servers
			data duplication : for other servers to pick up load
			partitioning: 50% users on server A, 50% users on server B
	b) Extensibility
		solutiion should be easy to change
		ex 
		Code: sends message to million users
		If want to change tweak/add functionality to that code (for ex check if users have read messages)
		How can i tweak?	

		Problem
		If code: is highly coupled with feature ---> if change in requirement --> lot of effort in redesigning and testing and deploying code again

		Solution:
		Make features extensible
		Gather all experiences
		Build better system --> expect it to scale + extend as requirements change
		


	c) Testing:
		Once a system is designed in real world by Engineer
		Have to test the design

		How can we test?
		c.1) Run requests : with common test cases
		c.2) Check if requests have sensible flow in system
		c.3) Use tools : load test design
			have capacity estimation --> Check if design is feasible
